# breathe
This is a website for mindful breathing with a visual aid.

## Project Development Process
This project started as a part of my other project, Playground, and my delight in discovering CSS loaders. A CSS loader experiment in that project prompted the question "what would it look like if it was much bigger and also based on the golden ratio?"

It went through many iterations. First, it only had 4 circles. Then it was only black and white. And then it was larger, but had 12 loaders; then back to 9. Then I realized I could make it look like it was breathing, and realized it could be a relaxation aide. The size of the loaders, the speed of their rotation, etc, are based on the golden ratio.

## I Learned
- Front-end frameworks are a huge time-saver... I might never go back to not using them.
- Art comes in all forms - the loader was incredibly fun to make.

## Ideas to Improve
- Add fast, slow, and fast->slow modes
- Turn the Move button/concept into its own, separate project
- Add mobile responsiveness
- Add more descriptions for accessibility
