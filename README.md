# breathe
This is a website for mindful breathing with a visual aid.

## Project Development Process
This project started as a part of my other project, Playground, and my delight in discovering CSS loaders. A CSS loader experiment in that project prompted the question "what would it look like if it was much bigger and also based on the golden ratio?"

It went through many iterations. First, it only had 4 circles. Then it was only black and white. And then it was larger, but had 12 loaders; then back to 9. Then I realized I could make it look like it was breathing, and realized it could be a relaxation aide. The size of the loaders, the speed of their rotation, etc, are based on the golden ratio.

## Reflection Log
Below are things I learned, mistakes I made, and my big takeaways from this project.
- Time flies if I love looking at what I'm making
- Taking time away from projects I feel really invested in is difficult but necessary for the creative process and brain
- Sometimes, iteration really is the only way to get to where I need to go. I can't always know where exactly I'm going.
- I need/enjoy but get too rigid/attached to parameters. I was wholly committed to using the golden ratio throughout the entirety of this project but I ended up deviating from this parameter for colors. RGB codes worked but the visual results were not pleasing/in line with the then-nascent philosophy of the project, so I took another approach with color. Reluctantly. After a lot of futzing. I could have saved myself a lot of time if I had embraced a less rigid perspective on my project parameters.

## Ideas to Improve
- Add fast, slow, and fast->slow modes
- Turn the Move button/concept into its own, separate project
- Add mobile responsiveness
- Add more descriptions for accessibility
